Experimenting with a permaweb comment/reply data protocol.

## Goals/Motivations

Users:

- can comment on any piece of arweave data
- can reply to comments and other replies
- can like comments and replies (Could use stamps core?)

Devs:

- can easily query comments for any content on arweave (sdk/hooks)
- can easily embed and customize comment module into their app (renderer/ui module)
